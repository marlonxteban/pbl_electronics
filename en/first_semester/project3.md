# Project 3: Basic Electrical Circuit Simulation

**Objective:** Teach students to use free software to simulate electrical circuits and compare the simulated results with those obtained from physical assemblies.

## Project Steps:

1. **Software Installation:**
   - Download and install a circuit simulation software such as LTSpice or Qucs.

2. **Circuit Design:**
   - Design various basic circuits (series, parallel, mixed) using the software.

3. **Simulation and Analysis:**
   - Run the simulations and analyze the results obtained (current, voltage, resistance).

4. **Comparison with Real Results:**
   - Compare the simulation results with those obtained from previous physical assemblies.

5. **Report and Presentation:**
   - Write a report including screenshots of the simulations, analysis of results, and a comparison with real data.

## Required Information:

- Fundamentals of electrical circuits
- Basic operation of the simulation software
- Analysis of results and comparison with theory

## Recommended Bibliography:

- "Circuit Simulation with SPICE OPUS: Theory and Practice" by Tadej Tuma and Árpád Buermen
- Official manuals and tutorials of the chosen software (LTSpice, Qucs)
