# Project 2: Analysis of an RLC Series Circuit

**Objective:** Introduce students to AC circuits and transient responses in RLC circuits.

## Project Steps:

1. **Circuit Design:**
   - Draw a circuit diagram that includes a resistor (R), an inductor (L), and a capacitor (C) in series with an AC power source.

2. **Circuit Assembly:**
   - Use a breadboard, resistors, inductors, capacitors, and a signal generator.

3. **Transient Response Measurement:**
   - Use an oscilloscope to observe and record the transient response of the circuit.

4. **Data Analysis:**
   - Analyze the obtained data and compare it with theoretical predictions.

5. **Final Report:**
   - Write a report explaining the behavior of the circuit and how it correlates with the theory.
