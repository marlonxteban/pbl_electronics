# Project 1: Building a Simple LED Circuit

**Objective:** Introduce students to the basic concepts of current, voltage, and resistance.

## Project Steps:

1. **Circuit Design:**
   - Draw a simple circuit diagram including a power source, a resistor, and an LED.

2. **Circuit Assembly:**
   - Use a breadboard, connecting wires, resistors, LEDs, and a power source (can be a battery).

3. **Measurement of Electrical Variables:**
   - Use a multimeter to measure voltage, current, and resistance in different parts of the circuit.

4. **Analysis and Report:**
   - Write a detailed report explaining the design, construction, and results obtained, explaining how Ohm's laws were verified.

## Required Information:

- Ohm's Law
- Series and parallel resistances
- Use of multimeters
